# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps track of changes in files over time. It's useful because it allows users to see how and when they edited a repository.
By keeping track of each edit, version control also allows users to revert any changes- they can go back to a working version of their files, and look at the differences to identify where an edit might have caused an issue.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the original set of files. By using a branch, users can experiment with adding features and editing previous files without editing (and potentially breaking) a working 'master' branch. 
Branching is also a good way to track what new edits are being made; each appropriately named branch can focus on one individual feature. 


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit officially publishes any chosen edits or changes to the local repository. Every commit should be accompanied by a commit message briefly describing what changes or additions are being committed.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two or more different changes are being made concurrently to the same file. This causes a conflict, since Git does not know which change is the "proper" code.
