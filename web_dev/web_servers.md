###What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* Users have the freedom to run any programs for any purpose and modify each program as they see fit
* Users can redistribute copies as much as they would like

### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
* A VPS is a copy of an OS hosted on a virtual server, allowing users to use that OS without having to physically own said OS / machine.
* Because these servers are software, users are able to customize them more easily. They are also much cheaper to own compared to a physical server.

###Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
* The root user has all administrative privileges, so any programs ran can modify OS files and important data- potentially to disastrous effect.
