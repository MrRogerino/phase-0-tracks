You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
  query: 
         SELECT * from reviews 
         JOIN businesses on reviews.business_id=businesses.id 
         JOIN users on reviews.user_id = users.id
  output: 
        1|4|Decent sushi, nice ambience|5|3|5|Sushi World|3|Angela|Jolie
        2|5|You're my boy, Amir!|7|1|7|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|1|Bradford|Pitt
        3|2|Mamma Mia, this club was dirty!|3|6|3|The Beagle Nightclub|6|Merryl|Streepman
        4|3|Just your run of the mill yoga cats here|4|5|4|Lotus Yoga|5|Holly|Berry

There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
  query: 
         SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment 
         FROM users, businesses, reviews 
         WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id
  output:
        Angela|Jolie|Sushi World|4|Decent sushi, nice ambience
        Bradford|Pitt|JoeBob's Sportz Barn|5|You're my boy, Amir!
        Merryl|Streepman|The Beagle Nightclub|2|Mamma Mia, this club was dirty!
        Holly|Berry|Lotus Yoga|3|Just your run of the mill yoga cats here

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
  query:
        SELECT * 
        FROM businesses, users, reviews 
        WHERE businesses.id = reviews.business_id AND users.id = reviews.user_id AND businesses.id = 5
  output:
        5|Sushi World|3|Angela|Jolie|1|4|Decent sushi, nice ambience|5|3
