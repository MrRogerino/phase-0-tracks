Robot Elevator Algorithm

- Figure out which floor number you are on. 
- Figure out which floor number you want to go to.
	- If the destination floor number is higher, call an elevator going up. 
	- If the destination floor number is lower, call an elevator going down.
	- If the destination floor is the same, don't board an elevator.
- Once elevator arrives, get in.
- For each button, look to see if it matches the destination floor number.
	- If it does match, press it.
	- Otherwise, check the next button.
- When elevator stops, check the floor number.
	- If the current floor matches destination floor, get out.
	- Otherwise, stay in the elevator.  

Real Life Algorithms

Cuisine Algorithm (how to decide which food to get)

- Roll a six-sided die. 
	- If 1 is rolled, get Chinese food. 
	- If 2 is rolled, get Italian food.
	- If 3 is rolled, get Mexican food. 
	- If 4 is rolled, get Indian food.
	- If 5 is rolled, get American food.
	- If 6 is rolled, starve.

Gym Algorithm

- For each workout
	- Do 8 reps
	- Rest 30 se.conds.
	- Once 24 total reps are reached, go on to next workout.

- Once each workout is done, look in mirror.
- Feel inadequate because there are bigger people than you.
- Feel sad.
- Go home.
